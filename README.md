## Delimitations:

* We will not be writing the source code for the neural networks. Instead, we will use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) and [TenslowFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* We will only use FOREX data as source for financial data (other sources  do not provide real-time data)
* The problem will be treated as a classificatiom problem rather than a regression problem (maybe)
