    *PLACEHOLDER* Time series forecasting---predicting future values of variables within a domain---is a largely unsolved problem in complex or chaotic domains such as weather (e.g. humidity, temperature or wind speed) and economics (e.g. currency exchange rates or stock prices). Long short-term memory (\textsc{lstm}) variants of recurrent neural networks (\textsc{rnn}s) are powerful models that have recently been applied with success to predict future time series sequences from historical, sequential datasets; such as predicting the weather for the next twenty-four hours, or predicting the next sequence of words in natural language. In this paper, we will attempt to investigate the problem by applying \textsc{lstm}-based \textsc{rnn}s, something that has not been done before. *PALCEHOLDER*\\
